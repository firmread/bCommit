# Thai New Year
after half month of the fools
I hope this will be a great start

They said that you only have two life
and you only live the second when you realized you only have one.

It's a beginning, although I'm not totally sure of what.
It should be a day that I'll be able to do whatever I wanted to
what I really aspired to do.

I wonder how much of that is true.
But it is this doubt that hold me back.
Self doubt that I kept for myself.
I get much easier every time I talk it out with someone.

That way I'm able to see myself again
That way I could finally let myself be exposed
the weakness of myself

It's a thai new year.
it's time to clean up
dust off those dreams
and put it to use again


happy new year.
