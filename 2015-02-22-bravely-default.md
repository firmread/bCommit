I really like their main plot
right now I'm at the beginning of the third chapter

The first chapter had this setting of old greedy and deceptive king vs. crystalist religian struggle. 
The second, highly consumerism metaphor used here. citizen had no say and the military is wiping out crystalist
now the third, CIVIL WARS! 

whoever write this script is damn clever!
much better than the old Final Fantasy stuffs!

reminds me of Final Fantasy Tactics A,, the best meta storyline i ever played...

they mastered the form, then perfect it with deep social issue reference and metaphor
cool, man. 
cool!
