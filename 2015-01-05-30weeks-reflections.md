# Where am I today?
## On my own,,, 
Not sure if it is a good or bad thing, but I've always been living my life like a hitchhiker. I'm not the one who drive, someone else always does. I just pick which one I'm going to take to move forward. However, now with 30 Weeks, the driver seat is empty, and I’m the only person who care enough to make this happen.

## middle of nowhere
I’ve so many things going-on all at the same time, and it seems that I really need to focus on one. Really passionately, to be able to succeed. I’m always bad at grading in school, because I always find extra curriculum that is more interesting or other things that I just so naturally attracted to to work on. 

Multiple scenery introduced with 30 weeks, yet it not feeling like: “been there, done that “ at all for me. It actually more like “that is tough”, “I wish I get better at that” kind of feeling. Yet I’m not sure how to take that forward. 


## Releasing and finishing, see things to the end
To be able to 

BURN

## I learn
I listen to myself more 
There are things that I naturally passionate about. More project ideas I wish to explore. And the only way to move on seems to be to finish what I’m working on right now. Finish it so that I’ll never regret looking back. And that’s the only way to really learn the whole lot out of it. 

It’s not that hard to talk with people
I did get better at it. And it’s awesome when you can find person that cares about things that is similar to ourselves. 

I’m a nerd. There are things I wish existed, and I want to be the one who create it. 
I hope that will bring me to make much greater things. 

But one step at a time. 
one cautious firm step

My doubt stop me the most
be clear, push till the end

## get more out of this program
never try to fit myself into it. 
reach out more
connect more
show more
make more
less doubt
