Nasopharyngeal tumor
Google top results only replace it with Nasopharyngeal cancer
If it isn't that this had been going on for weeks, I would say you got me fool.
Or it's me who is the fool here?
High possibility with Asian dude. Exposed to some fancy virus.
Airbnb hack might just got me that way.
Or it's been going on long before that?

I do hope it's young and recent.
I do hope it's other kind of tumor.

On one hand I'm still at the beginning.
On the other, maybe this is the end.

Did I had a life at all?
Did I even lived at all?

Hopeful thinking won't get me out of this.

Just think that I'll die anyway might be the best actually
It's the carefree that is cursed
It's those carelessness that let great things slipped away.

Put this into the equation.
Make life choices.

where I would rather die?
how
what is it I need to do before then?
