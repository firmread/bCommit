lunar
because you're so close by and that drive me crazy
we once in love, and I'm still in love with you.
we sprang away. 

maybe for good. maybe not. 
Who knows. 

life moves on in very weird pace without all the classrooms and walks. 
within this new found freedom, I find myself completely lost the way. 

I had something like this before... 
but back then I never had this discovery. 

I've already discover the way once. How come I can come back to where all things are lost again?

I feel like there is this way though. 

I love that midnight. 
When we met and walk together. 
the walk that apprently have a destination. 
but the goal was just to be there with you. 

it travels to all the road I've seen
every vertical and horizontal lines. 

every place you dream of, every place you seen

because of you're coming so close by again miss lunar.
I'm turning into a lunatic
I'm turning into a wolf

crazy, like in love. 



passionate every key pressed
passionate every word spilled


dream of day that this was always true. 
days that I thought it would last forever.
