## three things I'm grateful of today
* Girlfriend who is struggling with her life. She shows me how lucky I am to just live my life as-is.
* Family that understand and support me whatever shitty self I am. 
* That I'm still able to dream and see opportunity at this age. I just had to commit to it. Make it now, or it will never come.
