## An inaugural commit

I'm not even sure what this repo suppose to be yet. I'm having this hunch that eventually I won't be able to stand myself making 'nothing' out of this. Yet for now, the idea is just to commit something up to github. At least one commit a day. 


### 1 song, 1 commit, 1 post
that is my 2015 resolution. 

* Playing a song, keep my heart and soul alive
* Making a commit, keep myself true to the craft of coding
* Posting a thing up to social media, one thoughtful thing I make and publish it each day. 

In this everchanging life, 
There are these habits that will help me stay true and focus to oneself

### each day: 1 pomodoro for exercise, writing, and being out of myself
secondary resolution, 
this will keep my physical, mental, and social health up and healthy


### things I want to be able to accomplish this year
* keep these commitments true throughout the year
* publish all the works that I've stocked up, don't clog myself with old thought. Find place for all ideas, interests, and hobbies. Reach out and find more possiblities. 
* make a living, financial truth is one crucial truth life has to comply. Be true to my own financial situation. 


Each day, I will allow myself to have any guilty pleasure that doesn't require more than $10 if I able to commit to all these. 

Looking forward to know more of you, Mr. 2015,
Best,
Reed
