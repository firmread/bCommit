## A New Post

This is something I put up for New Year post on my [facebook](https://www.facebook.com/firmread/posts/10153614631978868). Just thinking it is nice enough to be recorded so I copied it over here too. 

## there goes the post

It’s easier to see a day passed than a year.

The earth rotates around itself once and we call it a day. 
The moon orbits around the earth once and we call it a month.
The earth orbits around the sun once and we call it a year.

each day we see the sunrise and sunset
each month we see the tide changes up and down
each year seasons loop through

a life though, occurs once

Time tides away faster and faster, it seems that this train will never slow down. Like a gravity at work, with me in free fall without a way to come back up. For this year, I just hope to learn how to use a parachute and seize more out of each passing day during this one way fall.

Everything that you can’t let go will eventually become part of you. 
So hope you choose wisely what to hold on and what to let go.

Thanks to everyone I’ve met and been around. You rock. Hope you all finds true happiness.
