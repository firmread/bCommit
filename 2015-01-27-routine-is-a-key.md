## three things i'm grateful of
* be able to make some of really shitty choices in life. not everyone live in a family who will understand and allow this. << understanding
* be able to connect to so many people who share the same passion in music and code like Phil or Jason << connection
* still have luxury to learn new things more and more. not just sit in that cube somewhere just like another gear in someone's else system << freedom
