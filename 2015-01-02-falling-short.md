## Second day, starting quite late

I'm not totally sure if tying up the writing pomodoro with the one commit is totally a great idea. It seems that I'll need some level of privacy while doing this kind of free writing. However, just for today, I'll explore more of how it might or might not works. 

I'll need much more focus on a project at hand. Building habit supposed to happen first thing in a day. Then it gets out of the way and allow me to have those flexibilities in lives, not the other war around. Where it becomes burden I carry over the whole day till the end. While both case could still co-exists, many people have their evening routines. I just don't trust myself enough for it. (guess who know me well here.) 

## outside

Being outside of myself assignment is also quite tricky. I'm not totally sure how it should be done in practice yet. I think it's the best to take a baby step at a time, just can't figure out the baby step from almost absolute zero I got here :P

Can't believe this is just a second day of the year. It absolutely has no sense of the second of something whatsoever. Just another day of life, mundane as ever. Guess it is the best for me to keep myself motivated. Go out and see more arts. Be inspired and alive. Being in too much, being too familiar of everything in everyday is so close to creative blocks. Got to push myself outside of this comfort zone. 

I think nonsensenyc is a good start. Just trust the recommendation and explore anything outside. Make myself available to the world... 

## meta-me

As I see this turns out to be quite personal rant, in which never necessary cool to be part of this repo. Well, the repo also represent zero expectation in content so that is also fair. I'm getting into my kind of vibes where I just worry too much about meta stuffs and got nothing done. Maybe some way around this would be helpful. The habit should help me focus on the action and while I'm on the action I should be able to let my mind free yet commit to the action. This is the only way to go through it. 

Not doing and think is all cool. After you done all your commitment of a day, that is. 

All framgmented and not focus thought. Not that anyone would ever read this anyway. So I should continue. The pomodoro is still ticking. 

## Actually, I should end it here for now

Let me think a bit more about specific, many stuffs should not go public just yet. If you ever read it to this point, either make PR for comments or poke me through [email](firmread@me.com) or [twitter](twitter.com/firmread) I just love to hear that the audience is exist, like, ever. 

Cheers,
