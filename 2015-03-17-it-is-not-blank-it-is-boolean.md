# it is not blank, it is boolean
when I started out this project (or just repo, not totally sure what to call this) my thought was just that this should be more of a call for action that would allow be to get into the groove of code, version control, and development. However, it turns out to be more of some kind of daily diary with broken promise. You know, just like how you would plan to write the diary and the beginning of the year and gradually slack it off.

On Kawara just died last year. I think his most respectful series of drawing the date on the canvas everyday sounds a little too simple at first. Only when I then see the huge calendar that marks decades of not missing a day on this project that I realize how much commitment this person poured into the project.

With similar retrospect and inspiration, github activity graph served in the way that is really similar to On Kawara's calendar. It greens up when you commit. This meant to be similar sort of connection. I want this act is my way of saying I'm commit to this practice. Daily check in will allows me to think and reminds myself what I care about. This dairy might not going to get as conceptual as Kawara's work but I hope it will live on for as long as his commitment did.

It's a boolean.
You either do it, or you don't.

That is what commitment is.
