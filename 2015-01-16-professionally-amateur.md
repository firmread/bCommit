# routine is what makes professional
allow myself to slip away and only do things when I feel like it, is not so professional. 
It is a little tough for me to confront it but it always been my problem. 
I like to stay away and see things from distance. It's take a lot more affort to make a real change. 
Yet also because of that should not means that I won't be able to do things my way well. 
But I'll have to pour my affort into it. 

intervention. 
invention. 
intuition. 

develop stuffs. confront it. don't hide. 
be fearless. 

cheers,
