talked with Decho about The Dead Poet Society
Reminds me of Zach Lieberman's talk in eyeo 2013
after that heartfelt point made in that part of the talk
Decho shared Of Monster and Men new song, crystals.
In which the top comment at the time said that
the actor in the MV reminds him of Robin Williams.

that you are here
that life exists and identity
that the powerful play goes on,
and you may contribute a verse.

What will your verse be?
