Spacey ended his speech with an anecdote about the last time he saw the late Stanley Kramer, 
acclaimed director of films including Guess Who’s Coming to Dinner and It’s a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad, World. 
Spacey recalled telling the director that he had long admired his work, that what he made “stood the test of time.”

“He said, ‘Thank you so much for saying that. 
That means so much to me. 
I just wish my films could have been better,'” 

reminisced Spacey, before ending his speech by echoing Kramer’s words:

“I just wanted to be better. I wish I could be better. But this is a great encouragement.”
